My name is Pavel, and I live in the Ukraine.

This blog is where I share my thoughts, ideas, and experiments with varying levels of detail. The content is primarily focused on programming, as I currently work as a software engineer. However, having explored various fields and industries, you might find occasional detours into other topics as well.

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you enjoy the read!
